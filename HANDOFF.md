## Session Summary (2026-06-09)

### v69 — Firebase leaderboard / highscore system (#12)
- Player name input in intro overlay (persists via localStorage)
- Firebase Firestore `scores` collection — open-write, no auth
- Every game auto-saves full telemetry (17 fields: score, day, wear, food, crew, morale, won, endReason, nodes, tradesMade, camps, eventsResolved, weather, cartItems, tradeGoods, distance, seed)
- Leaderboard overlay after end-game: Hall of Fame (top 10) + My Scores (personal history)
- My Scores sortable by: score, day, wear, food (asc), tradesMade, nodes, eventsResolved, morale
- Local fallback for offline: scores saved to localStorage, synced on next load
- Engine: added `game.getScoreData()` public method
- Files: `src/firebase.js` (new), `src/systems/engine.js`, `src/main.js`, `src/template.html`, `package.json`

### v67 — Camp dice rolls + flavor text; More actions fix
- Added dice roll animation to camp actions (rest, forage, hunt, scout)
- Added rich flavor text for all 7 camp actions (3 tiers: high/mid/low, 3 variants each = 63 flavor texts)
- Camp action buttons now show descriptions (e.g. 'Sleep and recover. Crew may improve.')
- Fixed 'More actions' toggle to only show when craft has usable recipes (#39)
- campAction() now returns roll + rollTotal for UI animation
- Files: `src/systems/engine.js`, `src/main.js`, `src/template.html`

### v66 — Item-giving events for unobtainable items
- 6 new events giving items that were previously only in the starting cart:
  - `plains_medicine_herb`: find sage/yarrow → Medicine Pouch
  - `plains_abandoned_cart`: salvage from abandoned cart → Spare Axle or Shaganappi
  - `river_valley_canvas_cache`: HBC supply cache → Canvas Tarp
  - `wooded_firewood_gather`: dead poplar stand → Firewood Bundle
  - `upland_blanket_find`: abandoned hunter's camp → Blanket
  - `river_beaver_trade`: beaver ponds → Beaver Pelts (or food from fishing)
- All use existing `give` code path — no engine changes
- 7 new source entries: LACOMBE_HERBS, BREHAUT_ABANDONED_CARTS, FONSECA_HBC_SUPPLY, SCHULTZ_DEADFALL, GOULET_BLANKET, FONSECA_BEAVER
- Sim results: 27.5% win rate (target 25-40%), diverse death distribution
- Files: `src/data/events.js`, `src/data/sources/index.js`

### v65 — Weather system (#13)
- Added weather system with 5 states (clear, overcast, rain, storm, snow) via season-aware Markov chain
- Weather modifiers: food consumption, wear accumulation, morale drift, event chance, camp recovery
- 4 new weather events: plains_thunderstorm, plains_windstorm, river_valley_flash_flood, upland_early_snow
- 6 new source entries: LACOMBE_STORM, FONSECA_RAIN, SCHULTZ_SNOW, LACOMBE_WIND, BREHAUT_WET_AXE, FONSECA_OVERCAST
- Weather indicator in status bar with emoji + color coding
- 64 new weather-specific travel narrative fragments (4 per state × 4 terrains)
- Weather fragments take priority over crew-state fragments during non-clear weather
- Sim results: 29% win rate (target 25-40%), diverse death distribution
- Files: `src/core/constants.js`, `src/systems/engine.js`, `src/data/events.js`, `src/data/sources/index.js`, `src/main.js`, `src/ui/renderer.js`, `src/template.html`, `dist/index.html`

### v64 — Atmospheric travel narrative + unload button labels
- Replaced debug travel text with 48 atmospheric fragments (4 terrains × 3 crew states)
- Unload buttons now show item name: "Unload Pemmican Rations (−2.5 kg)"
- Files: `src/main.js`

### v63 — Win rate normalization balance pass
- DAILY_FOOD: 1.2 → 1.35, starting food: 30 → 27
- Wear accumulation: plains 0.08→0.10, river_valley 0.12→0.15, wooded 0.15→0.20
- Fix `consumesItem` in resolveChoice() — Medicine Pouch now consumed by cholera event
- Lowered sim triumphant threshold: 1400 → 1100
- Sim results: 35% win rate (target 25-40%), diverse death reasons
- Files: `src/core/constants.js`, `src/systems/engine.js`, `tests/simulate-entry.js`

### v62 — Item-giving events for crafting input replenishment
- 4 new events that give crafting input items as rewards, making crafting a renewable system:
  - `plains_abandoned_camp`: find 2× Shaganappi at a cached campsite (plains pool)
  - `plains_hbc_cache`: find 1× Bison Hide from an HBC supply cache (plains pool)
  - `wooded_rope_find`: find 1× Rope (50ft) left beside the trail (wooded pool)
  - `river_valley_ammo_trader`: trade 3 food for 1× Ammunition Belt (river_valley pool)
- All use existing `give` code path in `resolveChoice()` — no engine changes
- New source entries: `BREHAUT_ABANDONED`, `FONSECA_SUPPLY_CACHE`, `BREHAUT_AMMO`, `GOULET_HIDE`
- Files: `src/data/events.js`, `src/data/sources/index.js`

### v61 — Crafting discoverability hint (#33)
- `.settlement-action-btn.secondary-action`: `var(--clr-bg)` → opaque `#d4c9b4`
- `.settlement-action-btn.utility-action`: `rgba(255,255,255,0.45)` → `rgba(210,200,180,0.92)`
- Duplicate stat headings (#43): replaced `innerHTML` with `textContent` + `className` on stat-value spans in `renderStatusBar()`. Template labels are now the sole label source.
- Files: `src/template.html`, `src/ui/renderer.js`, `dist/index.html`

### v50 — 4 low-hanging bug fixes (#29, #30, #36, #37)
- **#30 (food decimals):** `DAILY_FOOD = 1.2` caused float values. Fixed with `Math.round(...*10)/10` after subtraction, `Math.floor()` on display in status bar and camp overlay. Files: `src/systems/engine.js`, `src/ui/renderer.js`, `src/main.js`
- **#29 (dice timing):** Pass/fail pill removed from `renderDicePill()`. Outcome only appears in `revealDiceOutcome()` after dice settle. File: `src/main.js`
- **#37 (Gabriel Dumont duplicate):** Removed `river_ferry_dumont` from river event pool. `ferry_gabriel` (river_valley pool) remains as the single Dumont event. File: `src/data/events.js`
- **#36 (first travel settlement):** Skip `pendingSettlement` when `S.node <= 1`. Player gets one clean travel before first settlement. File: `src/systems/engine.js`

### v56 — Crafting discoverability hint (#33)
- Hint line below settlement description when recipes are available
- Single recipe: shows name + inputs; multiple: shows count
- Hidden when no recipes match; styled subtle (small italic, muted color)
- Files: `src/main.js`, `src/template.html`, `dist/index.html`

### v55 — Added location/node markers on map (#26)
- All 16 trail nodes shown as colored circle markers
- Color-coded by settlement type (HBC=red, Métis=green, NWMP=blue, Mission=gold, Trading=brown, River=blue)
- Current node: larger (9px), filled; visited: small gray (5px); future: medium (6px)
- Tooltips on hover/tap show node name
- Files: `src/ui/renderer.js`, `src/template.html`, `dist/index.html`

### v54 — Grouped secondary settlement actions (#35)
- Primary actions always visible; secondary (craft) behind "More actions ▶" toggle
- Toggle text: "More actions ▶" / "Less ▲"
- No toggle on settlements with no secondary actions
- Extracted `renderSettlementAction()` helper, simplified empty-state buttons
- Files: `src/main.js`, `src/template.html`

### v53 — Consolidated action verb style (#34)
- Single pattern across all panels: verb-first label, cost inline, single line
- Travel: "Travel 1 Day" → "Travel", "Make Camp" → "Camp"
- Camp: "Rest Up" → "Rest", "Repair Cart" → "Repair", "Scout Ahead" → "Scout", "Dance / Fiddle" → "Dance"
- Camp costs: "1 food, 0 days" → "1 food", "1 day, no items" → "1 day", "0 days, no items" → "free"
- Settlement: label+subtitle divs → single text line with cost appended
- Removed dead actionLabel entries (forage, recruit, rumours, gossip, reinforce)
- Removed unused `.settlement-action` wrapper and label/subtitle divs
- Files: `src/template.html`, `src/main.js`

### v52 — Prune redundant settlement actions (#31)
- Removed `recruit` (dominated by `rest`), `forage` (camp version better), `rumours` (no mechanical effect) from all settlement types.
- Removed dead `settlementAction()` handlers for pruned actions.
- Settlement action counts: HBC 4, Métis 3, Trading 2, Mission 2, NWMP 3.
- Camp actions unchanged — all 7 have clear distinct tradeoffs.
- Files: `src/systems/engine.js`

### v51 — Dice outcome animation sync (#29 follow-up)
- Replaced hardcoded 500ms timeout with `animationend` event on die element. Outcome reveals exactly when `dice-settle` CSS animation (450ms) completes. Includes `revealed`-guard + fallback timeout.
- File: `src/main.js`

## Build & Serve

```bash
# Rebuild
cd /home/bayarddevries/metis-trail-v2-repo
bun scripts/build.mjs

# Serve (port 5173, not 8080 which is qBittorrent)
cd dist && python3 -m http.server 5173

# Verify
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' http://127.0.0.1:5173/
```

**Note:** Build script bumps `?v=N` in both `dist/index.html` and `src/template.html`. After every build, verify `src/template.html` matches or the next build will double-increment.

## Open Issues (GitHub)

### Bugs
- **#32** — Balance pass on unforgiving events (medicine pouch) — p2
- **(local #32)** — Overlay sequence: pre-departure shows before intro (was local ISSUES.md #32, may overlap with original fix in bootstrap)

### Enhancements (prioritized)
- **#10** — Basic icons

### Resolved (2026-06-09)
- **#12 — Highscore/leaderboard** — v69. Firebase Firestore leaderboard with Hall of Fame (top 10) and My Scores (personal history with 8 sort options). Player name collected at game start. Local fallback for offline.
- **#13 — Weather system** — v65. Added 5-state weather system (clear/overcast/rain/storm/snow) with season-aware Markov chain. Weather modifies food consumption, wear accumulation, morale drift, event chance, and camp recovery. 4 new weather events, 6 new source entries, weather indicator in status bar, 64 weather-specific travel fragments. Sim: 29% win rate.

### Resolved (2026-06-08)
- ** crafting inputs closed-system gap** — v62. Added 4 item-giving events so players can acquire Shaganappi, Bison Hide, Rope, Ammunition Belt mid-trail. Crafting is now a renewable system.
- **#33** — Crafting discoverability in settlement UI — v61. Hint line below desc when recipes available.
- **#26** — Add location/node markers on map — v55. Color-coded by settlement type, tooltips show names.
- **#35** — Reduce action-dense screens by grouping secondary actions — v54. Primary actions always visible; craft behind "More actions ▶" toggle.
- **#34** — Audit and consolidate action verbs — v53.
- **#31** — Prune redundant settlement/camp actions — v52.

### External (no code)
- **#25** — Cultural/peer review
- **#6** — AI writing trend review
- **(local #42)** — Playwright tooling blocker (can't browser-verify clicks)

## Known Pitfalls (from AGENTS.md)

- **Map init timing:** Always call `initMap()` during `bootstrap()`, not deferred.
- **Port 8080:** qBittorrent uses it. Serve dev on 5173.
- **Browser verification:** Playwright click is broken on mobile; use JS click or real device.
- **Build version drift:** Template is source of truth; sync after every build.
- **Engine API:** Every method called from `main.js` MUST exist on engine's return object or the render function silently dies.
- **Item field name:** Items use `wt` for weight, not `weight`.
- **`pendingSettlement` blocks travel:** Both "Continue West" and "✕" must call `settlementAction('continue')`.
- **Stale cart reference:** Never cache `game.getCart()` during offload loops — `offloadItem()` mutates internally.
- **Template CSS vs dist CSS:** The build script reads from existing `dist/index.html` (not `src/template.html`) for the base. CSS changes in `src/template.html` must also be patched into `dist/index.html` directly.

## Next Session Handoff — Icons + Remaining Review Items

**Priority:** Visual polish + remaining cultural review gaps.

### Icons needed for events
- 4 new events need icons: cart_fortress (🛡️), smallpox_trail (☠️), cart_raft (🛶), pemmican_process (🥩)
- ~16 existing events also lack icons (see full list in session notes)
- Art is being developed by another agent — integrate when ready

### Remaining from cultural review (#25)
- Secondary source reformatting: MMF_COMMUNITIES, CARLTON_TRAIL, NWMP_HISTORY read as Wikipedia rather than period voices
- Consider replacing with actual period excerpts or reformatting as "historical notes" vs "source quotes"

### Constraints
- No engine changes needed for icons — just add icon references to event data and CSS
- Source reformatting is text-only, no mechanic changes
